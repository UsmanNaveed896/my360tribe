                  <p className="font-thin">
                    My 360 Tribe was founded on the premise of support and
                    guidance for members of the Special Operations Forces (SOF)
                    community as they embark on the pivotal journey
                    transitioning from military valor to civilian achievement.
                    Transitioning for Operators can be very stressful as they
                    leave their brotherhood and community behind. My 360 Tribe
                    aims to bridge that gap, providing peer support of Operators
                    to Operators who have successfully transitioned and
                    understand the challenges of someone who has walked in their
                    shoes. Established by a cadre of SOF veterans and
                    insightful, experienced civilian mentors, our organization
                    is uniquely poised to address the multifaceted challenges
                    encountered by our operators during this critical time.
