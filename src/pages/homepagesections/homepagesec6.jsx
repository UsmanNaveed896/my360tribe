        "Brage Garofalo has been a transition mentor and coach with Special Operators for over a decade, and through this work saw firsthand the nuanced complexities that accompany transition, even more so for Operators. Transition is more than just the technical and tactical components; but also involves an emotional and intellectual aspect that needs to be addressed as well. My360Tribe was founded in the Summer of 2023 on the premise that Operators need a member of their own Tribe within the Special Operations community to work through the challenges that arise at any time as part of their transition.In addition to co-founding My360Tribe, Brage actively consults and volunteers with numerous veteran service organizations helping to develop, build and/or improve mentor programs and mentoring platforms. She was instrumental in helping to build and manage the Mentor program for The Honor Foundation as well as develop a transition-focused eLearning library for the members of Elite Meet. She is an advisor and lecturer in areas of company and culture research and the complexities of transition for Operators. She also served as a member of the Advisory Board and Board of Directors for organizations that support veterans and their families, including transition.Brage is also the Director of Clinical Study Management for a Bay Area biotech where she builds high performing teams and leads cross functional teams to develop and execute oncology clinical trials. Brage has over 20 years of successful implementation and execution of global clinical trials that led to several FDA approvals in numerous therapeutic areas, including pediatric oncology, HIV and the first cure for Hepatitis C.Brage and her husband currently reside in the San Francisco Bay Area with their rescue dogs Charlie and Eddie.",
