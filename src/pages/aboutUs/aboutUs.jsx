            My 360 Tribe was founded on the premise of support and guidance for members of the Special Operations Forces (SOF) community 
            as they embark on the pivotal journey transitioning from military valor to civilian achievement. Transitioning for Operators 
            can be very stressful as they leave their brotherhood and community behind. My 360 Tribe aims to bridge that gap, providing 
            peer support of Operators to Operators who have successfully transitioned and understand the challenges of someone who has 
            walked in their shoes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Established by a cadre of SOF veterans and insightful, experienced civilian mentors, our organization is uniquely poised to 
            address the multifaceted challenges encountered by our operators during this critical time.

            Operators are well-prepared, empowered, and supported by those who understand the emotional and intellectual challenges of 
            transition. Our mission is to bridge the gap between military service and civilian success, addressing the challenging 
            aspects of transition while honoring their service, exceptional skills, and experience. We are here to ensure these 
            Operators have access to the services that set them up for success during their transition and beyond.
